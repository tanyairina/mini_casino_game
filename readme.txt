# The Re-Creation of The Ninja Gold Game, but this time with Django.
# This is a mini-game that helps a ninja make some money!
# When you start the game, your ninja should have 0 gold. The ninja can go to different places
# (farm, cave, house, casino) and earn different amounts of gold.
# In the case of a casino, your ninja can earn or lose up to 50 gold.
# Your job is to create a web app that allows this ninja to earn gold and
# to display past activities of this ninja.

# Guidelines
# The four forms appear when the user goes to http://localhost:8000
# Use a hidden input tag in each form to pass the relevant location to the server
# Have /process_money determine how much gold the user should have
# For now, save the activity log in session
